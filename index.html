				<h1>Our Story</h1>
				<p>Our love story begins like many other classic romances: Dane gave birth to a chicken and Kate aced a standardized test. After that fateful week of medical training in northern Minnesota, it was all over. As wilderness guides, we were destined to reconvene the following summer.</p>
				<p>We spent three months together within spitting distance of the Canadian border, taking day trips to Thunder Bay and drinking bottles of Kokanee in a field. In the fall, Dane moved to Oregon to be within a half-day&rsquo;s drive of Kate&rsquo;s college in Walla Walla, Washington. After two years, we were having such a good time seeing each another every other weekend that it only seemed natural that we should move across the county together and attend graduate school. So we did.</p>
				<p>For two long years we labored in books at the humid bottom of the Midwest, until our young adventurous hearts couldn&rsquo;t stand to be estranged from the West any longer. San Francisco loomed heavy and foggy on the horizon, promising curious employment and big-city living for these two outdoor nuts, and so we settled across the Bay in the town of Berkeley.</p>
				<p>Last fall we finally made a great and noble pilgrimage back to Minnesota, our homeland. Upon arrival we drove six hours north into the far hinterlands, to YMCA Camp Menogyn, the place where we first met and fell in love. As fearless guides we paddled across Bearskin Lake in a raging windstorm, and on reaching the other side, Dane got down on one knee and asked Kate a question.</p>
				<p>While neither the chicken nor the test were present as witnesses, we promise it all went as planned.</p>

				<p>Check the forecast and dress for the weather, because we&rsquo;ll be outside a lot so long as the sky cooperates. October has some of the best weather Minnesota can offer, so it could be 70 degrees and sunny or 40 degrees and rainy. Dinner will be indoors no matter what, so never fear.</p>
				<p>We recommend you leave your spiky heels at home, unless you are passionate about aerating the lawn.</p>

				<h1>&ldquo;Where should I stay?&rdquo;</h1>
				<p><em>Sleep in the Barn</em> &mdash; The barn has enough space to sleep eight to ten people in comfortable, heated, dorm-style accommodations complete with mattress, sheets and bathroom. Let us know if you are interested in staying the night and we&rsquo;ll reserve you a spot, first-come, first-served. Did we mention this option is <em>free?</em></p>
				<hr>
				<p><em>Sleep in the Yard</em> &mdash; Don&rsquo;t like sleeping indoors? Neither do we. The farm property has plenty of grassy space to pitch a tent.  Spend a night among the stars overlooking two lakes. Let us know if you&rsquo;re interested in this option and if you need a tent. We have a few extras. Also? Free.</p>

				<p>A fine chain hotel. Kate and Dane have fond feelings for the AmericInn, ever since they spent a winter night at one in an abandoned Medora, North Dakota. Have <em>you</em> ever stayed at a hotel with a private adjoining town?</p>

				<h1>Gifts?</h1>
				<p>We both feel lucky to have all the personal possessions a couple could ask for. To be quite honest, sometimes our tiny apartment makes it feel like we already have more than we need! To us, your presence and kind wishes are the greatest present we can imagine for our special day.</p>

<h1>&ldquo;No, really.<br>We&rsquo;d love to give the two of you something special.&rdquo;</h1>

<p>Given our engagement story, it shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise that <a href="http://www.ymcatwincities.org/camps/camp_menogyn/">YMCA Camp Menogyn</a> has an outsized place of our hearts.</p>

<p>For the last 90-some-odd years Menogyn&rsquo;s been sending small groups of young people on eight- to fifty-day canoeing, backpacking, and rock-climbing trips. We don&rsquo;t wanna get too preachy, but this place truly changes lives&mdash;including ours. Sometimes things move too fast, our lives get too complicated, and we get distracted from the things that matter most. Menogyn is a place to reconnect with your body and spirit&mdash;and have a rollicking good time carrying a ninety-pound wood canvas canoe through a bug-infested swamp.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, sending your kid on a rustic canoe trip is pretty darn expensive and not something every family can afford. A few years ago the Logan family set up the <em>Jean Pendray Logan Memorial Fund</em> in honor of Kate&rsquo;s mom, who died of cancer at the age of 55. The fund helps endow &ldquo;camperships&rdquo; so more kids can attend camp.</p>

<p>You can donate by sending a check made out to <em>YMCA Camp Menogyn</em> to the address below. Please write <em>Jean Pendray Memorial Fund</em> in the memo line to ensure money gets directed to the right spot.</p>
